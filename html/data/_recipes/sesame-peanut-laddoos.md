  * Mix both white and black sesame.

  * Roast the sesame seeds in a deep skillet until they are aromatic and start
  popping. This will take around 3-4 minutes on a medium flame. Transfer it to a
  plate and let it cool.

  * Now roast the peanut in the same deep skillet till you achieve the crisp
  texture with roasted peanut aroma. This will take around 7-8 minutes on medium
  flame. The peal of the peanut will turn golden brown, do not let it tar and
  become black. Transfer it to a separate plate and let it cool.

  * Once the peanuts is cooled, you can remove the peal of the peanut for better
  taste.

  * In a food processor, pulse the roasted peanuts first till you get an almost
  fine powder. Do the same with the sesame seeds.

  * Mix the sesame, peanut powder, cardamom powder and pulse for 2 minutes or
  so, until the natural oils are released and they come together.

  * Now add the powdered jaggery and pulse for 10-20 seconds so that all the
  ingredients mix well.

  * Remove onto a plate and shape them to balls of desired size.

  * Can be stored in a box and consumed over a weeks time.
