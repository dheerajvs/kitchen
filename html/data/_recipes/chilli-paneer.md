recipeInstructions: >-
  * In a marinating bowl, add plain flour, corn flour, red chilli powder, black
  pepper, ginger-garlic paste, table salt and mix well. 

  * Add water and whisk it well to make a thick batter of medium consistency
  without any lumps. 

  * Add the paneer cubes to the batter and gently give it coating of the batter.
  Let the paneer soaked in the batter rest for 5 minutes to absorb all the
  flavors.

  * In a shallow frying pan, heat oil and add the marinated paneer cubes one by
  one using a spoon and fry them to crisp on medium heat. As they turn golden
  brown, flip them couple of times so that all the sides are fried to crisp.
  Transfer the fried paneer to a dry plate with a paper towel to absorb all the
  extra oil.

  * Tempering the sauce

  * Continue to use the same pan that has the felt over oil after frying paneer
  to prepare the tempering sauce. 

  * On low heat, add ginger paste followed by finely chopped garlic peaces,
  green chilli and fry till you get a nice aroma of ginger-garlic. Note, not to
  tar them up.

  * On medium heat, add diced capsicum and fry for a minute. Note, not to fry
  for long. Capsicum needs to be crunchy.

  * Add onion, white part of finely chopped spring onion and fry for a minute.

  * On low heat, add red chilli powder and saute it well. 

  * On medium heat, add soya sauce, stir well and get it to boil for 2 minutes.

  * On low heat, add corn flour mixed in 2 tbsp water. Note to keep stirring
  well as you are adding the corn floor water so that lumps are not formed. 

  * For semi gravy consistency, add additional 2-3 tbsp of water. Not required
  to add additional water for appetizers.

  * Mix well and let it boil on medium heat for 2-3 minutes, so that there is no
  raw taste of the corn flour.

  * Add salt as per the taste required and stir well.

  * Add fried paneer cubes and mix well. 

  * Turn off the heat and add vinegar. Mix well again.

  * Finally garnish by sprinkling some finely chopped spring onion.

  * You are ready to serve.
