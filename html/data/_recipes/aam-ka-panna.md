  1. Rinse the raw mango thoroughly.

  2. Pressure cook the raw mango for 2-3 whistles till the raw mango becomes
  soft and pulpy.

  3. Once the pressure settles, remove the peel from the cooked raw mango and
  get the pulp to a blender.

  4. Add salt and sugar / jaggery to the raw mango pulp in the blender and blend
  it to a smooth paste and strain it to an air tight container and refrigerate.

  6. Aam ka panna can be served cold by mixing 1 tbsp of refrigerated aam ka
  panna to a glass of cold water along with a couple of ice cubes and mint
  leaves. Mint leaves adds additional flavor.


  Notes:

  1. Raw mango can be roated on fire or charcoal to soft pulp instead of
  pressure cooking. This gives a different taste.

  2. Aam ka panna can be diluted with soda instead of water.
