recipeInstructions: >-
  * Remove the thorny skin and the hard upper surface of the raw jack-fruit. The
  tender pulp above the fibrous surface has to be retained. The center
  cylindrical rim also needs to be removed. Chop them into small pieces.

  * For Masala: In a blender add grated fresh coconut, half onion cut to big
  pieces, green chilies, cinnamon, clove, fresh coriander leaves, ginger, garlic
  and little water to grind it a smooth paste.

  * Heat oil in a pressure cooker, add finely chopped other half of the onion.
  Keep sauteing till it turns translucent.

  * Add finely chopped tomato and saute it till it turns soft.

  * Add turmeric powder, coriander powder, chili powder, and saute it. 

  * Add the masala paste and saute it till it separates out oil. 

  * Add chopped raw jack-fruit pieces into the cooker. Add salt as per required
  taste. Saute it for 2-3 minutes, so that the raw smell and raw taste
  disappears. Add water and pressure cook for 3-4 whistles. Number of whistles
  depends on the tenderness of the raw jack-fruit. If its un-cooked, you may
  need to pressure cook for another 2-3 whistles.

  * Once the pressure leaves, serve it with hot-hot rice. Can be had with tawa
  roti also.


  # Tips

  * Can use raw banana instead of raw jack-fruit
