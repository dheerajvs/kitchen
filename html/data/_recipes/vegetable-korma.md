recipeInstructions: >-
  * Take all the ingredients mentioned under "Masala Paste" in a blender and
  grind to a smooth paste by adding required amount of water.

  * Heat oil in a pressure cooker.

  * Add curry leaves, followed by onion and saute till the onions become
  translucent.

  * Add chopped tomatoes and turmeric powder. Saute for 4 to 5 mins till the
  tomatoes soften.

  * Add the ground masala paste and saute till oil starts to leave the sides of
  the paste; This takes about 4 to 5 mins on a low flame. Keep sauteing often,
  so that the masala paste does not stick to the bottom of the cooker.

  * Add 1.5 cups water.

  * Add salt as per required taste.

  * Mix well the contents, cover the pressure cooker with its lid and pressure
  cook for 2 to 3 whistles on medium flame. Turn off the frame and let the
  pressure settle by itself.

  * Remove the lid, mix well from the bottom and then garnish with some
  coriander leaves. Serve the vegetable korma with chapatis, parathas, pooris or
  ghee rice.
