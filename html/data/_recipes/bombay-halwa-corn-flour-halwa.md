recipeInstructions: "* Take corn flour in a mixing bowl and mix it well with 1 cup of water without forming any lumps. Keep aside.\n* Heat 1 cup water in a thick bottomed, non-stick pan. Once the water gets to boil, add sugar. Allow the syrup to boil.\n* Pour corn flour mixture into the boiling sugar syrup and stir continuously on medium to low flame till the corn flour mixture starts to boil and starts to thicken.\n* Add lemon juice, ensure to keep stirring till the mixture thickens completely.\n* Add a tbsp of ghee at a time, in regular intervals and mix continuously till all the ghee is absorbed and the halwa turns glossy and transparent releasing ghee from sides.\n* Add food color, cardamom powder and cashews. Continue to stir till it forms one big semi solid lump.\n* Transfer the mixture to a flat square or rectangle bowl that has a coating of ghee to make it non-stick. Level the upper surface of the halwa, once transferred to the bowl.\n* Sprinkle sliced almonds, press the almond slices gently so that it sticks to the surface of the halwa well. Let the halwa rest for an hour in the bowl.\n* After an hour, the halwa is well set to be cut into cuboid pieces. Ready to be eaten as dessert or anytime of the day.\n\n# Tips\n* Stir continuously, so that the halwa doesn't form lumps and knots.\n* Adding lemon juice will prevent\_sugar from crystallizing.\n* Cooking the halwa longer turns the halwa rubbery and chewy. \n\n\n\n"
