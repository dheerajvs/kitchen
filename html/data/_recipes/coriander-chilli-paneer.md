recipeInstructions: >-
  * In a dry bowl, add the red chilli powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder,
  salt and lemon juice. Mix them all well and marinate the paneer cubes by
  giving an even coating of the mixture. Keep aside for a while for the paneer
  to absorb all the flavors.

  * In the meantime, take the coriander leaves and green chillies in a blender
  and blend to a smooth paste by adding little water.

  * Heat oil in a pan over medium flame. Add garlic followed by ginger paste and
  saute them. 

  * Once you get a nice aroma of ginger-garlic, add capsicum cubes and fry for
  1-2 minutes based on the crunchiness required.

  * Add onions and cook them until they turn light brown.

  * Once done, add the coriander paste from the blender and let it cook for a
  while till the raw smell of the paste disappears. Generally, for 2-3 minutes.
  Add, salt as per your taste. Remember the paneer is already marinated with
  some spices and salt. Don't add too much salt.

  * Add the marinated paneer cubes and cook for 2 minutes. 

  * Transfer the dish to a serving bowl and serve hot.
