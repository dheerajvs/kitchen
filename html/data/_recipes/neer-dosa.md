recipeYield: 8-10 dosas
recipeIngredient: |
  - Rice
   - 1 cup, washed and soaked for 2 hours
  - Coconut (Optional)
   - 1 cup, fresh grated coconut
  - Salt
   - As per taste
  - Water
   - 6 cups 
recipeInstructions: "* Soak rice in 1.5 cup of water for at least 2 hours. I generally soak overnight, so that I can make neer dosa for breakfast.\n* Transfer the soaked rice to a blender, setting aside the water used for soaking. If you choose to use coconut, transfer that also to the blender.\n* Rice-Coconut mixture needs to be ground to a very fine batter, without any coarse particle of rice or coconut. Initially grind without adding any water. Water used for soaking, that was drained and set aside can be used while grinding, which will be around a cup if measured.\n* Once a smooth batter is formed, transfer to a bowl and add salt, approximately 1 tsp. Add 5 cups of water in addition to 1 cup used while grinding if you are using coconut, else 2 to 2.5 cups will be sufficient (Note: The batter consistency should be watery, thin and flowing just like that of thick milk). Batter is ready to make yummy, soft and thin dosa.\n* You can use a cast iron pan or a non stick pan. If using a cast iron pan, sprinkle some water to check the temperature of the pan. If the water droplets sizzle and evaporate, then the pan is ready to make dosas.\n* Just spread Â½ tsp oil for the very first dosa to season the pan using a small piece of cotton kitchen towel (or you can dip half of an onion in oil and smear the pan with the halved onion).\n* Stir the batter in the pan\\/bowl and take a ladle full of batter.\n* Then pour the batter moving outwards to inside like the way we do for Rava dosa or you can just spread the batter by tilt or rotating the pan (Note: Do not spread the batter with the back of the ladle like the way we do for regular dosas). Fill in the large gaps too with some of the batter.\n* Neer dosa is never flipped, as they are very thin. Just the base has to be cooked well. When the dosa is cooked, it separates from the pan. The edges starts to raise by itself. At this stage using your fingers, raise the dosa from one edge of the pan and fold to make a triangular shape on the pan itself.\n* So made dosas can be placed in a plate without touching each other till it cools or can be served hot-hot as they are getting done.\n* Neer dosa can be had\_with coconut chutney, vegetable\_sagu or kurma. Neer dosa remain soft even after they get cooled down. So you can serve them later too."
