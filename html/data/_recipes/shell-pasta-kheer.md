recipeInstructions: >
  * Soak saffron strands in 2 tbsp of warm milk.

  * Heat ghee in a pan and fry cashews to golden brown, now add resins to the
  same pan and wait for them to puff. Once done remove the cashews and the
  resins from the pan and set aside.

  * In the same pan add the pasta of your choice and roast them for about a
  minute with the left over ghee. This removes the raw smell of the pasta and
  gives a very nice aroma and thin coating of ghee. This also ensures that the
  pasta don't stick to each other when cooked. Let it cool a bit.

  * Now in a thick bottomed vessel with a lid, bring water to boil and cook the
  roasted pasta on medium to low flame till they are 80% cooked. This will take
  about 10-15 minutes based type of pasta you've chosen. For shell pasta it
  takes about 15 minutes. Keep stirring it occasionally so that the pasta don't
  stick the base of the vessel. Once done, drain out the water in the vessel.

  * To the same vessel that has the 80% cooked pasta, add milk and cook it to
  100% by stirring occasionally. This will take another 10 minutes.

  * Now add powdered cardamom, sugar and cook for about 2 minutes with stirring.
  Add condensed milk and the soaked saffron strands. Cook for another 1 more
  minute.

  * Finally garnish with the ghee fried dry fruits of your choice like cashew,
  resins, almonds, pistachio.

  * Note: You can use jaggery or honey instead of sugar. Jaggery needs to be
  melted to a syrup by mixing it in water. Pasta doesn't cook any further once
  you've added jaggery. Ensure your pasta is fully cooked before adding jaggery.
  Also its not safe to cook or boil honey, once added.
