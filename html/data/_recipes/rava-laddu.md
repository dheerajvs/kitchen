recipeInstructions: >-
  * Heat 1 tbsp of ghee in a pan on medium heat. Once hot, add cashew and fry
  till golden brown, now add raisins and fry till they puff, finally add cloves
  if you wish to add. Now remove the cashew, raisins and cloves from the pan and
  keep aside.

  * Add the remaining ghee to the same pan, once the ghee is hot, add the rava
  and roast it by stirring continuously till you get a nice aroma. This will
  take around 6-7 minutes.

  * Once roasted, set aside and let it cool down a bit.

  * Once the rava has cooled down a bit, grind it using a blender, to coarse
  (Note, not to make it to a fine powder). Transfer to a large bowl.

  * Grind together granulated sugar and cardamom seeds to a fine powder in a
  blender. 

  * Mix sugar-cardamom powder into the rava.

  * Add hot milk or hot water to the bowl having the rava-sugar-cardamom mixture
  and mix well and rest it for a while.

  * Take a small amount of mixture in your hand, press it with your hands to
  form round shaped balls. You can insert a cashew piece, raisins and a clove
  while making the balls.

  * Repeat the process till the mixture is over. I was able to make 20 laddus.
