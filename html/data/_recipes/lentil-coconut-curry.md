  * Salt
  * As per taste
  * Grated fresh ginger (Optional)
  * 1 tsp
  * Green Chilli (Optional)
  * 2-3 finely chopped
  * Water
  * 2 cups
recipeInstructions: >-
  * Wash toor dal thoroughly and pressure cook with water. The water should be
  just sufficient so that after cooking, the dal retains its shape and is not
  mushy. The dal should be dry after cooking.

  * Add oil to a cooking pan and heat it up on medium flame.

  * Add channa dal wait for 10 seconds, now add urad dal and wait for the dals
  to turn golden brown. Ensure you saute the dals so that they don't tar up on
  one side.

  * Add mustard and let it sputter. Once it starts to sputter add curry leaves,
  let the curry leaves become crisp.

  * If you wish to add green chilli and ginger, you can add it now and wait for
  around 10 seconds with sauting.

  * Add turmeric, salt as per required and mix it well.

  * Add the cooked dal and fry a little.

  * Add the grated coconut and saute for a minute so that the fresh smell of the
  coconut disappears.

  * Remove from heat and serve with hot rice.


  # Tips

  * The ratio of toor dal can be increased or decreased, as required. The dal
  can be eliminated altogether.

  * You can choose to use moong dal or channa dal instead of toor dal.

  * This curry is traditionally sweet due to coconut. You can add green chillies
  or jeera powder or grated ginger etc. to spicy it up. I love it with green
  chillies and grated ginger.
