recipeIngredient: |-
  - Rice flour
   - 4 cups, additional rice flour for dusting
  - Water
   - 6 cups
  - Cooking oil
   - 1 tbsp
  - Salt
   - 2 tsp or As per taste
recipeInstructions: "* Boil water in a slightly deep thick bottom pan. Once the water starts boiling, add the salt and oil.\n* Take 1/2 cup of rice flour and mix it with little water to form a paste, add the paste to the boiling water. or if youâ€™ve left out cooked rice, add little water to it and blend it to a smooth paste. Making a paste like this acts as a binder and avoids cracking and the roti turns out soft and fluffy. Let it cook for a minute.\_\n* Add the remaining 3 1/2 cups of rice flour to the boiling pasty water in one go, reduce the heat and cover the pan with a lid. Let it cook for about 5 minutes. DO NOT mix or disturb the rice flour.\n* After 5 minutes, with the help of a spatula, mix the rice flour vigorously to get a lumpy mixture. \n* Turn off the heat and let the mixture cool down for about 10 minutes. Keep the pan covered with a lid, while it cools.\n* When the mixture is cool and warm enough to meddle with it, with slightly wet palms, knead the warm dough well to form a smooth, non-sticky dough. The kneading is best done with hands. Kneading the dough is important for soft fluffy rottis.\n* Take a small ball of dough, knead well, make it to a round ball. Flatten the dough ball by rolling it into a circular rotti with a rolling pin. Dust the rolling surface with rice flour as necessary to avoid stickiness while rolling.\n* Heat a flat pan, preferably cast iron. Non-Stick pan will also do.\n* You can either cook the rotti on the tawa on both sides until brown spots appear OR Put the rotti on the pan, and let it cook for a minute until it is just barely cooked. Now flip it on the other side and cook it well until you see brown spots on the surface. Now place the rotti on a direct flame, on the undercooked side until the rotti puffs up like a balloon.\n* Serve hot-hot rottis along with Pickle or Chutney or Yennegai or Hitikida Avarekalu Saaru or Panjabi Bindi or any other curry of your choice."
