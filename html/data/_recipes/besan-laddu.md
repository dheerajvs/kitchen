recipeInstructions: >-
  * In a blender, add sugar and cardamom seeds and make to a fine powder and
  keep aside.

  * Melt ghee and keep it lukewarm.

  * In an heavy bottom pan, add 1 tbsp of ghee and fry cashew till golden brown.
  Now add raisins and wait till it puffs. Remove the cashew and raisins from the
  pan and keep aside.

  * To the same pan, add another 2 tbsp of ghee and wait till it becomes hot.
  Now add basin, and stir continuously on low-medium flame, never let the basin
  tar or become tarred or form lumps. Keep stirring for 4-5 minutes. Add another
  2 tbsp of ghee and continue to stir for another 4-5 minutes. Finally add the
  remaining ghee and continue to stir for another 4-5 minutes.

  * In about 15 minutes, the raw smell of the basin should have gone and start
  giving out a nice aroma. Now add sugar-cardamom powder and mix well. 

  * Turn off the heat / burner and let it cool a bit.

  * Take a small amount of mixture in your hand, press it with your hands to
  form round shaped balls. You can insert a cashew piece, raisins or any other
  dry fruits (Pista, Badam ...etc.) while making the balls.

  * Repeat the process till the mixture is over. I was able to make 20 laddus.
