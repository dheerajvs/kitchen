  # Tips

  * Its important to roast the rave. It'll remove the raw smell of the rave and
  avoids turning pasty once cooked.

  * Before adding water, you can opt to add 1/2 tsp of Garam Masala and saute it
  well for 10 seconds.

  * Khara Bhath can be relished with coconut chutney.

  * Khara Bhath is generally complimented with kesari bath.
