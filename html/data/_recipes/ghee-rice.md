  low.

  continuously while sauteing the raisins and cashews. Remove them from the pan
  and keep aside.

  and turn fragrant. Do not let them burn.

  * Immediately add the green chillies followed by sliced onions, stir and saute
  till the onions turn golden or caramelize.

  * Now add the soaked rice, gently stir the rice so that the ghee coats the
  grains evenly.

  * Now add the coconut milk and water.

  * Add salt as per taste. 

  * Cover the pan with a tight fitting lid. Simmer till the rice is cooked and
  all the water is absorbed. OR if you are using a pressure cooker, pressure
  cook for 1 whistle on medium flame.

  * Let the whistle settle by itself if using pressure cooker, else once the
  rice grains are cooked, give a standing time of 5 to 6 minutes. remove the
  lid. fluff with a fork.

  * Serve the ghee rice hot, garnished with fried cashews, raisins and some
  finely chopped coriander leaves. Ghee rice tastes so good, that you can even
  have it plain without any accompanying curry or dal or vegetable korma.
