recipeInstructions: >-
  * Clean, wash and roughly chop doddapatre / ajwain leaves.

  * In a cooking pan, dry roast cumin seeds, pepper and green chilli for a
  minute. Once cooled, transfer it to a blender and grind it to a fine powder.

  * Into the same cooking pan, add doddapatre leaves and saute for about 2-3
  minutes or till the leaves turn soft and change their color. Turn off the
  flame and keep aside to cool. 

  * Transfer the roasted leaves to the blender containing the spice mix along
  with coconut, ginger and salt. Grind it to a very smooth paste by adding just
  a little water.

  * Heat oil in the same cooking pan. Add mustard, once the mustard starts to
  sputter, add cumin, then add curry leaves followed by red chilli. Now add the
  ground            paste in the blender to the cooking pan. Wait for it to cook
  for about 2 to 3 minutes. Once the oil separates from the thambuli turn of the
  heat. 

  * In a bowl take curd and churn it to form a smooth cream. Pour this into the
  pan containing thambuli. Adjust the consistency as required by adding water.

  * Serve doddapatre thambuli in room temperature with hot steaming rice.


  #Tips

  * Thambuli can also be done with radish, gooseberry, ash guard or bottle
  guard.

  * If you are doing with radish or gooseberry, you'll need to wash, dry, grate
  and then roast it with a teaspoon of cooking oil.

  * If you are doing with ash guard or bottle gourd you can remove the peal and
  boil it with a pinch of salt and turmeric. Do not grind this.

  * Rest of the procedure remain the same.
