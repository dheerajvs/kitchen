  #Tips

  * Thambuli can also be done with radish, gooseberry or ash guard.

  * If you are doing with radish or gooseberry, you'll need to wash, dry, grate
  and then roast it with a teaspoon of cooking oil.

  * If you are doing with ash guard you can remove the peal and boil it with a
  pinch of salt and turmeric. Do not grind this.

  * Rest of the procedure remain the same.
