recipeInstructions: >-
  * Drizzle lime juice over apple cubes and toss well, so that the lime juice
  gets coated well. This will prevent cut apples from de-coloring to brownish.

  * Mix grapes, celery and walnuts.

  * Blend together honey, low-fat yogurt and mayonnaise.

  * Pour it over the apple mixture and mix well; Chill for about an hour. 

  * Waldorf salad is ready to be served as an appetizer or as a light meal
