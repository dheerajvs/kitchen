  # Preparations

  * Soak almonds overnight and peel the skin. Alternatively you can boil them in
  hot water for a few minutes and peel the skin.

  * Grind almonds with 1/4 cup of milk to a smooth paste.

  * Melt ghee in a kadai and keep it aside.

  * In the same kadai (as it is coated with ghee, it will prevent the halwa from
  sticking to the bottom of the pan) bring 1/4 cup of water to boil, switch off
  the flame, add sugar and let the sugar dissolve completely.

  * Now add the badam paste, remaining milk, kesari color, saffron and cook on
  medium flame stirring continuously.

  * Once it starts thickening and the sides start getting a little dry and
  flaky, add all the ghee except 2 tsp and cook stirring continuously on low
  flame.

  * The ghee will be completely absorbed and the halwa will start leaving the
  sides of the pan.

  * Now switch off the flame, add the remaining 2 tsp of ghee and stir for about
  3-4 minutes.(this makes the halwa softer when it sets)

  * Once it cools the halwa will thicken.
