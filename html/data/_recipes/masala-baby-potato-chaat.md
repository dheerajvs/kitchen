recipeInstructions: >
  * Wash the potatoes and do not peel the skin. Pressure cook it for just 1
  whistle in water or just boil them in a closed vessel for 10 minutes. Make
  note, not to cook it for long as they will rupture to pieces when fried. Once
  cooked drain out the water and transfer the potatoes to a plate.

  * Using spatula gently press and flatten the semi cooked potatoes, so that
  they rupture but not break to pieces.

  * Heat oil in a non-stick pan. When the oil is hot add curry leaves. Once the
  curry leaves becomes crispy, add the baby potatoes and cook on low heat for
  about 5 minutes. The potatoes will become slightly crispier. Cook the potatoes
  on both sides by turning them over in-between.

  * Evenly mix chili powder, coriander powder, dry mango powder, chaat masala,
  cumin powder and salt as required in a small bowl. Sprinkle the spice mixture
  on the potatoes in the pan, turn over the potatoes and sprinkle the spice
  powder again to get an even coating. Gently saute so that all the spices get
  evenly coated and well absorbed by the potatoes. 

  * Transfer to a serving dish and drizzle lime juice and  garnish with freshly
  chopped coriander leaves. 

  * Serve hot as a tea-time snack or as a starter

  # Note

  * If baby potatoes are not available, you can use any sized potatoes. Just cut
  them into bite size pieces.
