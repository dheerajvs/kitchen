  * Add minced ginger and chopped tomatoes and saute till the tomatoes become
  soft.

  * Add the chopped vegetables and saute for a minute to remove the raw smell of
  the vegetables.

  * Add the turmeric powder and mix well.

  * Add water and bring to a boil and add salt as per taste.

  * Reduce heat and slowly add the cracked wheat to the water and stir it
  continuously so that lumps donâ€™t form and it combines well with the water.

  * Place lid and simmer for 15 minutes or till the water is completely
  evaporated and the upma is done. Turn off heat and remove to a serving bowl.

  * Garnish with coriander leaves and serve warm with pickle or chutney of your
  choice.
