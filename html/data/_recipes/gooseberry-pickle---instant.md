recipeInstructions: >-
  * Wash and steam the gooseberry for about 10 minutes on low flame in about
  200ml water, till they open by itself. Once they start to open up turn off the
  burner and allow it to cool completely. Once the gooseberries are cooled,
  remove the seed from center and cut them to desired size.

  * For the Masala: Dry roast white mustard, fenugreek and fennel seeds till
  they turn golden. Allow it to cool and blend to fine powder. 

  * Heat oil in a pan and add the black mustard, once the mustard starts to
  sputter add asafoetida. If you desire to add curry leaves and garlic, you can
  add it now. Once the curry leaves and garlic turns crispy turn off the burner.

  * Add steamed gooseberries, saute it and leave it for a minute. Now add the
  chilli powder, turmeric, prepared pickle masala and salt as required and mix
  well.

  * Instant gooseberry pickle is ready to be served with rice or as a side dish
  with rotis, dosas or with any other any main course.


  # Tips

  * Choose tangy gooseberries or you can add fresh lemon juice as required to
  get the tangyness.

  * Steam gooseberries just till they develop the slits or just open up to
  remove the seeds. Over cooking makes them too soft and the crispness of the
  gooseberries is lost.

  * If white mustard is not available, you can choose to use black mustard seeds
  itself.

  * The instant gooseberry pickles stays good for around a month, if stored in
  an air tight container and refrigerated.
