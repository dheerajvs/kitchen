  # Procedure

  * In a pressure cooker dry roast the millet till the raw smell is removed and
  you get a nice aroma. Do not tar or burn the millet. Set aside and let it
  cool. Once cooled, wash the millet thoroughly and soak in water for about half
  an hour.

  * Pressure cook the soaked millet with the 3 times of water for about 3-4
  whistles. Once the pressure settles, take a bite to check if the millet is
  cooked to soft.

  * Add hot milk to the millet in the cooker and get it to boil. Cook for about
  7-8 minutes on medium flame. Occasionally keep stirring to avoid formation of
  lumps and tarring of the base.

  * Add condensed milk and continue to cook for another 7-8 minutes. Remember to
  keep stirring occasional ensuring that the base does not tar up. Check the
  sweetness at this stage and adjust to suit your taste buds.

  * Add cardamom powder to the kheer now and mix well and boil for another
  minute.

  * Add milk soaked saffron to the kheer. Mix well and get to boil for another
  minute.

  * Turn off the heat and garnish the Millet Kheer with slivered ghee roasted
  dry fruits.

  * Millet Kheer is now ready to be served for dessert. It can be served warm or
  chilled as desired.


  # Note:

  ## Variation 1

  * You may use sugar or jaggery or honey with additional 500ml milk, instead of
  condensed milk. 

  * If you are using jaggery, firstly powder the jaggery, dissolve in water and
  then strain it to remove any dust particles.

  * Boil the milk to reduce to half the quantity, make sure to keep stirring and
  not to tarup.

  * Add pressure cooked millet to the boiled milk which is now condensed and
  then cook further for another 7-8 minutes.

  * Later add sugar or jaggery. Quantity of sugar or jaggery can be adjusted to
  suit your taste buds. I prefer to add 1 cup, equivalent to 50 gms.

  * Another alternative sweetener is honey, if you are using honey, never cook
  it. Add it in the end and just mix well.



  ## Variation 2

  * You may use foxtail or barnyard millet or any other millet to make kheer.

  * If you are using other millets, the cooking time, water and number of
  whistles to pressure cook may vary. Check the softness once after pressure
  cooking.
