  * In a pressure cooker dry roast the millet to remove the raw smell and get a
  nice aroma. Do not tar or burn the millet. Set aside and let it cool.

  * Once cooled, wash the millet thoroughly and pressure cook with water for
  about 3-4 whistles. Once the pressure settles, take a bite and check if the
  millet is cooked to soft.

  * Add hot milk to the millet in the cooker and get it to boil. Cook for about
  7 minutes on medium flame. Ensure not to tar up the base, occasionally keep
  stirring.

  * Based on your preference you may choose to add sugar or jaggery or condensed
  milk. Continue to cook for another 7 minutes. Remember to keep stirring
  occasional ensuring that the base does not tar up. Check the sweetness at this
  stage and adjust to suit your tastebuds.

  * If you desire to add saffron you may now add the milk soaked saffron. Mix
  well and get to boil for another minute.

  * Turn off the heat and garnish the Foxtail Millet Kheer with slivered dry
  fruits. 

  * Foxtail Millet Kheer is now ready to be served for dessert. It can be served
  warm or chilled as desired.
