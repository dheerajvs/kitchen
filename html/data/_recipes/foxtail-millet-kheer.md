recipeInstructions: >-
  * In a pressure cooker dry roast the millet till the raw smell is removed and
  you get a nice aroma. Do not tar or burn the millet. Set aside and let it
  cool. Once cooled, wash the millet thoroughly and soak in water for about half
  an hour.

  * Pressure cook the soaked millet with the same water for about 3-4 whistles.
  Once the pressure settles, take a bite to check if the millet is cooked to
  soft.

  * Add hot milk to the millet in the cooker and get it to boil. Cook for about
  7 minutes on medium flame. Occasionally keep stirring to avoid formation of
  lumps and tarring of the base.

  * Based on your preference you may now choose to add sugar or jaggery or
  condensed milk. If you are adding jaggery, dissolve jaggery in 1/4th cup of
  water and filter it to remove the impurities. Continue to cook for another 7
  minutes. Remember to keep stirring occasional ensuring that the base does not
  tar up. Check the sweetness at this stage and adjust to suit your tastebuds.

  * If you've added sugar or jaggery, then add cardamom powder to the kheer now
  and mix well and boil for another  minute.

  * If you desire to add saffron you may now add the milk soaked saffron. Mix
  well and get to boil for another minute.

  * Turn off the heat and garnish the Millet Kheer with slivered ghee roasted
  dry fruits.

  * Foxtail Millet Kheer is now ready to be served for dessert. It can be served
  warm or chilled as desired.
