recipeInstructions: >
  * Soak strands of saffron in 1 tbsp of warm water or milk for 15 minutes.

  * Heat 2 tbsp ghee in a cooking pan on low flame and roast cashews, let them
  turn light golden color.

  * Add raisins, let them puff. Once the raisins puff, remove from the pan and
  keep aside.

  * In the same ghee in the pan, roast the rava or vermicelli on low flame for
  about 5 minutes till you get a nice aroma and it turns slightly golden brown.
  Keep sauteing, ensuring that it doesn't tar up.  

  * Add 1 cup hot water to the rava/vermicelli and stir continuously to ensure
  no lumps are formed. Wait for 2-3 minute till the rava/vermicelli absorbs the
  water completely.

  * Add sugar and stir well till the sugar dissolves. This may take around 2
  minutes.

  * Add saffron water or kesari food color or both.

  * Add cardamom powder, which gives a sweet flavor.

  * Add the remaining ghee and stir continuously, make sure that the mixture is
  combined well without any lumps.

  * Cover the pan for 2 minutes on low flame till rava/vermicelli gets cooked
  well completely.

  * Garnish with roasted cashews, raisins and mix well.

  * Serve kesari bhath as a dessert with either breakfast or tea time snacks.


  # Notes

  * Prepare Kesari bhath on low flame to avoid any lump formation.

  * Use fine rava for a better texture.

  * You can use 1 finely chopped small banana or 2 tbsp of finely chopped
  pineapple before adding sugar.
